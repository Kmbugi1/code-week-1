Code 2: Demerit Points Calculation



Based on a predetermined speed restriction and demerit point system, this application determines the demerit points that an automobile will receive for exceeding the posted speed limit. The speed of the car is input by the user, and after that, the demerit points are computed.

How to Apply:

If it isn't already installed, install Node.js.

By entering "node speed-detector.js" in your terminal, you can run the software.

Go into theIf the user stays within the speed limit, "OK" will be shown instead of the calculated demerit points.

Calculate your net salary after tax, NHIF, and NSSF using code 3.



Based on inputs for basic salary and predefined tax, NHIF, and NSSF rates, this program determines a person's net salary. The 'prompt-sync' package is utilized to collect user input for the starting wage.

How to Apply:

If it isn't already installed, install Node.js.

By entering "node salary.js" in your terminal, you may run the program.

When prompted, enter the person's base pay.

Based on the supplied rates and user input, the computer will compute and display the net tax, NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and net income.

These applications seem useful in a variety of situations, including assigning grades to pupils and computing demerit points for speeding.
